## What is this?

awesome-mcp-server is the community-driven catalog that powers [DeployStack's MCP Server Catalog](https://cloud.deploystack.io). When you contribute an MCP server here, it becomes available to thousands of developers worldwide through DeployStack's enterprise control plane.

This repository bridges the gap between individual MCP servers and enterprise-ready deployment infrastructure, transforming community contributions into production-ready tools with secure credential management and zero-configuration setup.
